    <h1>What is Blockchain?</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked
      together using cryptography.Each block contains a cryptographic hash of
      the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally
      represented as a Merkle tree). The timestamp proves that the transaction
      data existed when the block was published in order to get into its hash.
      As blocks each contain information about the block previous to it, they
      form a chain, with each additional block reinforcing the ones before it

    <h2>Smart contracts</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Blockchain-based smart contracts are proposed contracts that can be
      partially or fully executed or enforced without human interaction.One of
      the main objectives of a smart contract is automated escrow. A key feature
      of smart contracts is that they do not need a trusted third party (such as
      a trustee) to act as an intermediary between contracting entities -the
      blockchain network executes the contract on its own.
