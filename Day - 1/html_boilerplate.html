    <h1>Blockchain</h1>
    <p>
      A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked
      together using cryptography.[1][2][3][4] Each block contains a
      cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction
      data (generally represented as a Merkle tree). The timestamp proves that
      the transaction data existed when the block was published in order to get
      into its hash. As blocks each contain information about the block previous
      to it, they form a chain, with each additional block reinforcing the ones
      before it. Therefore, blockchains are resistant to modification of their
      data because once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered
      retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.
